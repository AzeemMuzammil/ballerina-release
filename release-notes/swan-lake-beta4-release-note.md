#### New Features

##### Debugger
- Added support for debug pause instructions. With this support, any running Ballerina programs can be suspended immediately at the current execution line of the program.
- [Preview Feature] Introduced Ballerina code completion support in the VSCode debug console. Now, a context-aware completion list will be suggested automatically for Ballerina expressions in the VSCode evaluation window.
- Added string template support for debug logpoints. Now, you can interpolate expressions within debug logpoint messages by using the `${}` syntax so that the debug logpoints can be used to log state variable information without suspending the program.
