### Updating Ballerina

If you are already using Ballerina, you can use the [Update Tool](/learn/tooling-guide/cli-tools/update-tool/) to directly update to Ballerina Swan Lake Alpha5 as follows. 

To do this, first, execute the command below to get the update tool updated to its latest version. 

> `bal update`

If you are using an **Update Tool version below 0.8.14**, execute the `ballerina update` command to update it. Next, execute the command below to update to Swan Lake Alpha5.

> `bal dist pull slalpha5`

### Installing Ballerina

If you have not installed Ballerina, then download the [installers](/downloads/#swanlake) to install.

### Language Updates

#### New Features

##### `lang.xml:data()` Lang Library Function

The `lang.xml:data()`  lang library function has been introduced to get the character data from an `xml` value. This function returns the character data of an `xml:Text` value as a string. For an `xml:Element` value this returns the concatenation of the result of invoking this function over the children of the element. Calling `lang.xml:data()` on comments, processing instructions, and empty sequences returns an empty string.

##### `lang.xml:getDescendants()` Lang Library Function

The `lang.xml:getDescendants()` lang library function has been introduced to retrieve a sequence of the descendant elements for a given element, in document order.

##### Bitwise Operations as Constant Expressions

Bitwise binary operations `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`, `^`, `&`, `|` are now allowed as constant expressions.

```ballerina
const BASE = 0x10;
const int SHIFTED = (BASE << 2) | 0xa;
```

#### Improvements

##### Improvements to the XML Literal

XML template literals now support the inclusion of multiple XML items of the same `xml` subtype as well as different `xml` subtypes.

```ballerina
xml x1 = xml `<ele>item</ele><!--comment-->text<?foo?>`;
xml<xml:Element> x2 = xml `<ele>item1</ele><ele>item2</ele>`;
xml<xml:Comment> x3 = xml `<!--comment1--><!--comment2-->`;
xml<xml:ProcessingInstruction> x4 = xml `<?foo?><?bar?>`;
string interpolation = "Interpolation";
xml<xml:Text> x5 = xml `text ${interpolation}`;
```

##### Normalization of XML Attribute Values
In XML template literals, character references within XML attribute values are now normalized to the referring character. For example, the value of the `e.attr` attribute in the following example is now `a&b`.

```ballerina
xml:Element e = xml `<elem attr="a&amp;b" />`;
```

#### Breaking Changes

- The `lang.array:lastIndexOf` and `lang.array:indexOf` lang library functions can only be used with arrays of which the element types are subtypes of the `anydata` type.
- A compilation error occurs if the field visibility qualifiers in the including type and the included type with object type inclusion are not the same.
- Remote method call action cannot be used to call non-remote methods.
- The `xml` and `readonly` type-descriptors can no longer be used as expressions. A reference to a type definition defined with such type-descriptors needs to be used instead.
- The argument passed to the second parameter of the `attach` method of the listener for service declarations has been fixed as follows. If there is no attach-point in the service, `()` (nil) is passed as the argument. If the attach-point is the root resource path ("/"), an empty array is passed.
- The `lang.xml:getContent()` function no longer accepts `xml:Text` as an argument. The new `lang.xml:data()` function can be used instead.
- `lang.value` functions cannot be called on expressions of type `object`. Function call syntax (`value:func(obj)`) can be used instead.
- The `lang.stream:reduce()` lang library function will only return the reduced value or an error (if the completion type includes a subtype of `error`). It no longer returns a nil `()` value. The return type of `lang.stream:reduce()` has been updated accordingly.
- An issue where the complement of numeric literals returned incorrect values has been fixed.
- An issue that allowed negation with numeric literals has been fixed. Negation can be used only with `boolean` values.
- Subtyping rules have been fixed to consider the `never` type, which denotes an empty set of values as a subtype of any type `T`.
- Relational expressions with lists have been fixed to consider the relative order of lists with different sizes.
- An issue where a non-error value did not match the wildcard match pattern at runtime when the matched expressionâ€™s static type included error has been fixed.
- An issue with Isolation analysis where transfer out validation did not happen when `self` was used in a return statement of an isolated object method has been fixed.
- An issue where the method qualifiers were now being set for a `readonly` and `class` intersection has been fixed.
