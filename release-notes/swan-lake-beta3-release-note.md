### Standard Library Updates

#### New Features

##### Log Package

Added Observability span context values to log messages when Observability is enabled.

##### SQL Package

Added support for queryRow() in the database connectors. This method allows retrieving a single row as a record, or a single value from the database.
```ballerina
record{} queryResult = sqlClient->queryRow(`SELECT * FROM ExTable where row_id = 1`)
int count = sqlClient->queryRow(“SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ExTable”)
```

#### Improvements

##### SQL Package

- Improved throughput performance with asynchronous database queries
- Introduced new array out parameter types in call procedures.
- The return type of the SQL query API is changed to include the completion type as nil in the stream. With this change, the below SQL query code,
    
    **Previous Syntax**
    ```ballerina
    stream<RowType, error> resultStream = sqlClient->query(“”);
    ```
    **New Syntax**
    ```ballerina
    stream<RowType, error?> resultStream = sqlClient->query(“”);
    ```

##### IO Package

Changed the `io:readin` function input parameter to optional. In the previous API, it was required to pass a value to be printed before reading the user input as a string. Decided to remove it, due to the breaking change, made it optional. It is not recommended to pass a value to print in the console.
